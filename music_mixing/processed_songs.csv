1,s.o.s,"jigitz, Tabi","The audio clip begins with a close-mic’d, intimate female vocal, singing in a clear, breathy tone with a slight melancholy, accompanied by a gently arpeggiated piano. The vocal melody is “S-O-S, someone said, never gonna let you down, found you in every crowd.” The recording features natural room reverberation and a faint analog-style hiss, with no other instruments present, creating an emotionally resonant, vulnerable atmosphere. The vocal performance is precise and emotionally expressive, with a subtle vibrato on the word “down.”

This section is abruptly cut off, followed by a brief silence, then a dramatic shift to a high-energy electronic dance track. The new section features a deep, pulsing bassline, crisp electronic drum beat, and a synthesized pad. The vocals return, now processed with heavy reverb and delay, delivering the lines: “To you, if I’m reaching out, it’s for you, if I’m going down, it’s for you, if I’m singing out, it’s for you.” These lyrics are sung in a more detached, ethereal style, reflecting the emotional transition from vulnerability to cathartic release.

As the song continues, the original piano and vocal motif returns, now remixed and integrated into the dance structure. The lyrics “S-O-S, someone said, never gonna let you down, found you in every crowd” are repeated, but this time the vocal is treated with heavy reverb and delay, blending into the dense, club-ready production. The arrangement now features a driving four-on-the-floor beat, wide stereo synth pads, and a heavily side-chained bass, all characteristic of modern progressive house or electro house. The mood is both euphoric and emotionally charged, with a sense of communal release.

The audio ends abruptly in the midst of the final vocal phrase, cutting off before the musical resolution, likely an artifact of the excerpt.

The recording is of high fidelity, with a broad frequency spectrum and clear stereo imaging. The mix is dynamic and well-balanced, shifting from an intimate, lo-fi ambiance to a polished, high-energy electronic production. The lyrics center on themes of distress, connection, and emotional support, with “S-O-S” serving as both a literal and metaphorical plea. The structure and sound design reflect the conventions of contemporary dance music, with a clear progression from vulnerability to catharsis. The absence of crowd or environmental sounds, combined with studio techniques and production choices, suggests the clip is a studio excerpt intended for broadcast, streaming, or promotional use, rather than a live performance.

In summary, this audio clip is a meticulously produced segment of a modern dance-pop song that transitions from an emotionally raw, piano-based intro to a high-energy electronic dance remix. It showcases the genre’s signature elements—vocal processing, driving rhythms, and a blend of vulnerability and euphoria—while highlighting the central theme of seeking and offering support during times of emotional crisis.",39.67492063492063,135.99917763157896,89,1741.8599646702646,3462.7003410254533,0.0694636506180514,4.362417221069336,168.33628845214844,"[0.24323435127735138, 0.35011112689971924, 0.29682570695877075, 0.3084580600261688, 0.36326953768730164, 0.24954168498516083, 0.24548128247261047, 0.22966806590557098, 0.36281707882881165, 0.32698893547058105, 0.20004558563232422, 0.2217811644077301]","[0.265908420085907, 0.32140180468559265, 0.31037628650665283, 0.3016101121902466, 0.29139071702957153, 0.24112668633460999, 0.23919302225112915, 0.25638309121131897, 0.344652384519577, 0.34412041306495667, 0.26693058013916016, 0.25345444679260254]",1777.7545825507957,2461.514592573929
2,tell you straight (Ely Oaks’ version),"jigitz, Ely Oaks","The audio clip opens with a gentle, sustained piano chord, its notes ringing softly into the ambient space. A subtle, high-frequency synth pad adds a shimmering backdrop, while a barely-there, low-frequency hum grounds the mix. The atmosphere is intimate and melancholic, setting a reflective mood. A female vocalist enters, her voice clear, breathy, and emotionally nuanced, delivered with a contemporary American accent. She sings, “You think I'm gonna fall in love when I'm not, babe,” her tone shifting from wistful to assertive, emphasizing the word “not.” The lyrics continue with “You want a life as a wife, but that's not my name,” delivered with a rising inflection and a touch of defiance. The next lines, “You been at home all alone, looking at the rain,” are sung with a plaintive quality, evoking a sense of longing and isolation. The final phrase, “I'm just gonna tell you straight, baby I will...,” is delivered with heightened clarity and confidence, the word “baby” trailing off into the next musical section.

As the vocals end, the instrumental abruptly transitions to a high-energy electronic dance groove. The piano chords are replaced by a deep, resonant synthesized bassline, a four-on-the-floor kick drum, and a syncopated, bright synth lead. The tempo is fast, and the mix is dense, with all elements tightly compressed for maximum impact. This section features a rapid, processed vocal sample—“baby I will”—which becomes a rhythmic hook, repeating in a chopped, stuttering fashion. The sample is manipulated with a filter sweep, creating a dynamic rise and fall in intensity, and is layered with a high-pitched, descending synth motif. The phrase “baby I will” is repeated multiple times, each instance accompanied by variations in filter and rhythm, maintaining the energetic, dancefloor-oriented mood.

The clip concludes with a return to the initial piano motif, now slightly altered and isolated, as the electronic elements fade out. The final moments feature a gentle, high-pitched synth flourish before the audio abruptly ends, leaving a lingering sense of emotional contrast.

In summary, the audio clip is a meticulously produced, emotionally charged electronic dance track that blends introspective lyrics and atmospheric vocals with a high-energy, club-ready instrumental. The production utilizes modern EDM techniques—layered synths, processed vocal samples, and dynamic filter sweeps—to create a track that is both personally expressive and suitable for dance environments. The lyrics, delivered in clear American English, focus on themes of independence, rejection, and emotional clarity, all underscored by the stark contrast between the intimate opening and the driving dance section. The absence of crowd or environmental sounds, combined with studio-quality mixing and mastering, suggests a contemporary, mainstream pop/dance release intended for broad appeal.",39.51238095238095,161.4990234375,95,2239.818487868035,4909.962515377129,0.0810211217501468,21.587995529174805,118.28024291992188,"[0.34939044713974, 0.257163405418396, 0.27419039607048035, 0.23305194079875946, 0.29991570115089417, 0.3772229254245758, 0.253389835357666, 0.317667156457901, 0.25109028816223145, 0.3504992425441742, 0.21488887071609497, 0.22991527616977692]","[0.3123464286327362, 0.25357958674430847, 0.26476597785949707, 0.2425500899553299, 0.29862838983535767, 0.31084713339805603, 0.22877071797847748, 0.2690137028694153, 0.26502129435539246, 0.37119799852371216, 0.32441580295562744, 0.29227784276008606]",1918.3365588225215,2231.418444593265
3,Too Late,Shankz,"The audio clip is a high-fidelity, professionally produced segment of a contemporary electronic dance music track, blending elements of future bass and modern pop. The song is performed by a female vocalist with a clear, breathy, and emotionally charged delivery, characterized by a distinctly American accent and a tone that is both vulnerable and assertive. Her voice is processed with lush reverb and subtle delay, placing her centrally in the mix and enveloping her in a spacious, atmospheric soundstage.

The musical arrangement features a prominent, melodic four-on-the-floor kick drum, crisp and syncopated hi-hats, and a deep sub-bass that underpins the emotional core of the track. A recurring, shimmering synth arpeggio cycles throughout, punctuated by a short, ascending melodic motif. The production is clean and modern, with no extraneous noise, and features subtle digital artifacts only in the most dynamic moments.

Lyrically, the song centers on a repeated, accusatory phrase: “You say too late to start,” which is repeated in a looping, chant-like fashion. Additional lines include “You know you better,” “I don’t believe in anything,” and “You say too late to start with your heart in a...” (the last phrase cut off abruptly at the end of the clip). The lyrics are delivered in a manner that suggests a confrontation or emotional reckoning, with the vocalist’s tone shifting from plaintive to defiant as the song progresses.

The structure of the clip is built around a repetitive vocal hook, with the main phrase “You say too late to start” serving as both the thematic and melodic anchor. The arrangement builds in intensity, with layers of synths, percussion, and vocal harmonies gradually added. The emotional arc culminates in a more assertive, almost defiant tone during the final lines, before the track is abruptly truncated mid-word, leaving a sense of unresolved tension.

The overall style and production point to a 2010s–2020s EDM/pop context, drawing on the conventions of future bass and mainstream dance music, with an emphasis on emotional resonance, polished sound design, and a blend of vulnerability and empowerment in the vocal performance. The absence of any spoken word, crowd noise, or environmental sounds confirms this as a studio-produced track, likely intended for radio, streaming, or club play.",40.0,66.25600961538461,42,3150.711582781177,6269.898863718804,0.1788512156304411,3.482253074645996,92.0329360961914,"[0.2134319543838501, 0.3322238624095917, 0.22807732224464417, 0.20472180843353271, 0.24561767280101776, 0.33012837171554565, 0.3361464738845825, 0.30279794335365295, 0.4283985197544098, 0.2966333031654358, 0.24177882075309753, 0.2148866355419159]","[0.2611657679080963, 0.2879611551761627, 0.25133025646209717, 0.24680782854557037, 0.28314080834388733, 0.25916075706481934, 0.31796491146087646, 0.28691431879997253, 0.34913018345832825, 0.331864595413208, 0.2758079469203949, 0.29315388202667236]",3569.0744055889004,3026.512428908748
4,"Better Off (Alone, Pt. III)","Alan Walker, Dash Berlin, Vikkstar","The audio clip begins with a full, energetic dance-pop instrumental, characterized by a bright, arpeggiated synthesizer melody, a deep and driving electronic drum beat (four-on-the-floor kick, sharp snare, crisp hi-hats), and a lush, wide stereo mix. The production is modern, with pronounced use of reverb and delay on the vocals and synths, creating a spacious and immersive atmosphere. The mix is clean and well-balanced, with a low-frequency sub-bass foundation, midrange synths and vocals, and bright, crisp highs.

At the 00:07 mark, the female vocalist enters with a breathy, slightly processed tone and a confident, emotionally charged delivery. Her accent is a General American English, with a subtle hint of Southern US inflection, and her performance is marked by a controlled vibrato and a slightly raspy quality. She sings the following lyrics:

""This could be a good night for good times, and you look like a good time. We're dancing to dancing in the moonlight. Now I want you back. Can you make me feel better?""

After a brief instrumental break, the chorus repeats verbatim. Throughout, the vocal track is layered with harmonies and ad-libs, including a repeated ""back"" at the end of the chorus, adding depth and emotional emphasis. The instrumental arrangement remains consistent, with the same synth, drum, and bass elements, and the production continues to showcase wide stereo imaging and dynamic compression typical of contemporary dance-pop.

At the end of the second chorus, the vocals abruptly cut off mid-word, leaving only the instrumental, which continues with the same energy and sonic character. There are no ambient sounds, crowd noises, or additional vocalizations; the focus is solely on the song’s performance and production.

The clip is a high-fidelity, modern pop/dance-pop track, likely from the late 2010s or 2020s. It features an upbeat, danceable instrumental foundation and emotionally charged lyrics about longing and connection. The production is polished and contemporary, with no regional or cultural identifiers beyond the General American English vocal style and the stylistic hallmarks of mainstream Western pop.

5,If You Let Me,"Albi, Sinéad Harnett","The audio clip begins with a female vocalist singing in a high, breathy register, her voice reverberating over a slow, melancholic piano melody. The lyrics, “hurts me the most when I wait,” are delivered with a tone of quiet sorrow and vulnerability, setting a somber mood. The piano chords are sustained and spacious, enveloped in reverb, while a faint, sustained synth pad adds atmospheric depth. The vocal is mixed to the forefront, with subtle reverb and a hint of digital delay, establishing a sense of emotional isolation.

As the music progresses, the piano maintains its reflective mood while a subtle, syncopated electronic drum beat enters, marked by a soft kick, a steady electronic snare/clap, and a crisp, high-frequency closed hi-hat. The vocalist continues with, “I fumble and twist,” her voice conveying emotional turbulence. The next line, “till the truth starts to click,” is accompanied by a slight increase in vocal intensity, suggesting a moment of realization. The piano and synth pad continue to provide harmonic support.

A new phrase, “There’s so much space in this bed,” is delivered with a sense of emptiness, enhanced by the wide stereo spread of the instruments. The singer’s voice remains centered and intimate, while the piano and synths fill the soundstage. The next line, “These sheets go for miles,” is sung with a breathy quality, and the instrumental arrangement remains sparse and atmospheric.

The mood shifts as the vocalist sings, “Dreams of your smile,” with a slight lift in emotional energy, hinting at hope. This is immediately followed by, “I don’t wanna be just a memory,” where the vocal intensity increases, and the arrangement subtly builds in anticipation.

The chorus begins with a marked change in the instrumental landscape: the drumbeat becomes more pronounced and dance-oriented, featuring a four-on-the-floor kick, crisp snare/clap, and a syncopated hi-hat pattern. The bassline enters with a melodic, syncopated motif, reinforcing the electronic, club-ready feel. The female vocalist belts out, “And I don’t wanna feel your lips break free,” her voice now more powerful and layered with harmonies, while the piano transitions to a staccato, rhythmic chord pattern. The chorus continues with, “Because without you I’m lost in the breeze,” as the arrangement grows more dense and energetic, and the vocals become even more intense.

The next phrase, “I gotta be strong now,” is delivered with a strong, determined tone, matching the rising intensity of the instrumental. The following line, “I gotta show you how I love you like I’ve never ever loved somebody,” is sung with heightened emotion and a sense of urgency, as the track approaches its peak. The bassline remains central, and the drums drive the energy forward.

The final section features the lyric, “I’ll give you things you didn’t even know you wanted,” delivered with a sense of confidence and emotional climax. The arrangement is at its most intense, with the bassline and drums driving the momentum. The next line, “Don’t tell me that it’s not enough,” is sung with a pleading, urgent tone, while the drums and bass continue their rhythmic interplay. The last phrase, “My time is up, you’re over us,” is delivered with a resigned finality, and the track begins to fade out, with the bassline, drums, and vocals gradually diminishing.

The recording exhibits high fidelity, with a full frequency range, clear separation of elements, and a well-balanced stereo image. The vocal is centered and intimate, while the piano, synths, bass, and drums fill the stereo field. The production features lush reverb and delay on the vocals and synths, and a compressed, punchy mix. The emotional tone shifts from vulnerability and longing to intensity and urgency, reflecting the song’s narrative arc. The lyrics explore themes of heartbreak, desire, and self-assertion, and the arrangement transitions from sparse, melancholic piano to a dynamic, dance-oriented electronic sound. The absence of audience noise, crowd sounds, or environmental cues confirms a studio setting, with the arrangement and production style characteristic of contemporary pop and electronic dance music.

In summary, the audio is a polished studio recording that blends emotive, English-language vocals with a dynamic electronic arrangement, moving from introspective vulnerability to a powerful, danceable climax. The lyrics express longing and heartbreak, and the production delivers a modern pop/electronic sound with high technical quality and emotional impact.",39.907120181405894,92.28515625,61,2277.7985640420434,4657.873599067409,0.0857554242110238,24.20309257507324,119.09190368652344,"[0.27365851402282715, 0.2982649505138397, 0.42210152745246887, 0.3090893626213074, 0.24754637479782104, 0.27060118317604065, 0.26983100175857544, 0.27230849862098694, 0.2641909718513489, 0.3117425739765167, 0.24583539366722107, 0.23143655061721802]","[0.26563018560409546, 0.2903241813182831, 0.36749351024627686, 0.3132982850074768, 0.29524385929107666, 0.26356881856918335, 0.2489837259054184, 0.3218807578086853, 0.2950636148452759, 0.2817235291004181, 0.23140107095241547, 0.26406529545783997]",1873.101583402689,2382.466411113846
6,Don't Forget My Love,"Diplo, Miguel","The audio clip is a professionally produced, high-fidelity excerpt from a contemporary pop/dance track, likely originating from the late 2010s or early 2020s. It opens with a brief ambient soundscape—soft, steady rain and a low, distant rumble of thunder—evoking a mood of introspection and emotional vulnerability. This atmospheric introduction, free of human noise, sets a contemplative tone.

At around five seconds, the rain and thunder are joined by a male vocalist who enters with a smooth, clear, and emotive tenor voice. The lyrics are delivered in English with a General American accent, and the vocal style is marked by a blend of melodic singing and gentle, rhythmic spoken-word inflections. The voice is treated with a lush reverb and subtle delay, creating a sense of space and intimacy, as though the singer is singing from within the listener’s own head.

The musical arrangement is built on a foundation of electronic elements: a steady four-on-the-floor kick drum, crisp hi-hats, a warm, rounded synth bass, and layers of lush, atmospheric pads. The chord progression is simple and consonant, in a major key, reinforcing the track’s emotional, romantic tone. A recurring, high-pitched arpeggiated synth motif provides additional texture and rhythmic interest. The production is polished and modern, with all elements clearly separated in the stereo field and an overall clean, spacious mix.

As the song progresses, the vocal and instrumental layers gradually intensify, building toward a climactic moment. The lyrics focus on themes of memory, intimacy, and longing, with phrases such as “Remember the feeling of my fingertips on your skin,” “the way that I kiss is taste sweeter after drinking,” and “just so you can feel me with your way when I'm not around.” These lines, delivered with a gentle urgency, evoke the physical and emotional closeness of a romantic relationship, tinged with a sense of absence and yearning.

The track’s structure follows a typical pop format, with a build-up in intensity and a brief, anticipatory pause before the final, emotionally charged line: “Don’t forget my love.” This phrase is delivered with heightened emotion and is immediately followed by a hard, abrupt cut to silence, leaving the listener with a sense of unresolved tension.

No extraneous sounds—such as speech, environmental noise, or crowd effects—appear at any point. The only non-musical elements are the initial rain and thunder, which fade out as the song begins.

In summary, the clip is a short, emotionally charged, and atmospheric segment from a modern pop/dance song, designed to evoke intimacy, longing, and romantic memory through its lyrics, vocal delivery, and carefully crafted electronic arrangement. The production is high-quality, and the overall mood is one of reflective longing, culminating in a powerful emotional crescendo and an abrupt, unresolved ending.",39.95356009070295,123.046875,83,2450.163873590703,5717.127989836033,0.0878795599397152,-0.4669432640075683,160.24560546875,"[0.277237206697464, 0.27670350670814514, 0.28784316778182983, 0.2990938723087311, 0.2941589057445526, 0.285501629114151, 0.2811618745326996, 0.28462308645248413, 0.286396861076355, 0.2867012321949005, 0.30651193857192993, 0.2966320514678955]","[0.2878628969192505, 0.32481473684310913, 0.3056904971599579, 0.24267011880874634, 0.2549866735935211, 0.24569720029830933, 0.3159325122833252, 0.2490423023700714, 0.2669106423854828, 0.33959534764289856, 0.28020787239074707, 0.32709550857543945]",2129.7256760298355,1803.9837049772475
7,Replay (with Dylan Matthew),"SLANDER, Dylan Matthew","The audio clip opens with a lush, modern electronic soundscape, dominated by a deep, synthesized bassline, atmospheric pads, and a subtle, high-frequency shaker. The production is clean, with no ambient noise or imperfections, and the stereo field is wide, placing the listener within a spacious, digitally constructed environment. This instrumental foundation is immediately evocative of contemporary pop, R&B, and electronic genres, with clear influences from late-2010s and early-2020s trends.

At the four-second mark, a male vocalist enters with a soft, breathy, and emotionally vulnerable tone. He sings the phrase, “If I could face you,” which is immediately followed by a second, nearly identical line, both delivered in a manner that is intimate and introspective. These lines are sung with a gentle, melodic contour, and the vocal is enveloped in a lush reverb, blending seamlessly with the instrumental bed.

The main lyrical section begins at 00:12, with the singer reflecting on a past relationship: “Do you remember those days when we thought we had it all? Such young love, but so incapable. We lost our innocence in the back of that car. I didn’t know that you would take it this far. So I sat back on that couch and I watched you fix your hair and I made you—.” The lyrics are delivered in standard American English with a neutral accent, and the vocal style—characterized by a soft, mid-range timbre, subtle vibrato, and a touch of rasp—conveys vulnerability and nostalgia. The phrasing is smooth and legato, with the final word (“made you—”) trailing off, indicating the clip is an excerpt from a longer piece.

Throughout the clip, the music remains emotionally charged but restrained, with a slow, steady tempo and a minor key that enhances the sense of longing and melancholy. The arrangement features a repeating bass motif, a high-frequency arpeggio, and a shimmering synth pad that contribute to the atmosphere. There are no abrupt transitions or changes in intensity; the mood is one of contemplation and emotional release.

The production quality is high, with the mix favoring a balanced blend of vocals and instruments. The vocal is centered in the mix, while the synth pads and percussion spread across the stereo field, creating a sense of depth and space. The dynamic range is compressed, maintaining a consistent volume and immersive feel. The recording is likely a studio or digital production, with no evidence of live performance or environmental artifacts.

In summary, the audio clip is a polished excerpt from a contemporary pop/R&B ballad, featuring a male vocalist reflecting on lost love and youthful innocence. The lyrics and musical style are emblematic of modern, emotionally-driven music, and the production is sophisticated, blending electronic elements with intimate vocals to create a resonant, introspective listening experience.",40.0,117.45383522727272,78,1589.9329056906613,3432.4713124138493,0.0411964279236796,14.015005111694336,160.00674438476562,"[0.23720571398735046, 0.30670103430747986, 0.3088128864765167, 0.2672286927700043, 0.3620612919330597, 0.2526647448539734, 0.27349233627319336, 0.22574123740196228, 0.26139023900032043, 0.3787841200828552, 0.28696364164352417, 0.2608754634857178]","[0.2716432213783264, 0.29683858156204224, 0.25439682602882385, 0.2597615122795105, 0.2913486361503601, 0.2252240628004074, 0.2784208655357361, 0.22240661084651947, 0.29385778307914734, 0.38381168246269226, 0.296262264251709, 0.349106103181839]",1157.28667624004,1801.8213911271932
8,Healing,"Gordo, Drake","The audio clip begins with the ambient sounds of a natural, outdoor environment—crickets chirping, faint birdsong, and a gentle breeze rustling through leaves—establishing a calm, tranquil setting. A male speaker with a distinct East African accent, likely from Kenya or Tanzania, narrates in a slow, reflective manner, describing a peaceful early morning walk. His tone is relaxed and intimate, and he shares personal thoughts about his wife: he fondly recalls their conversations, laughter, and shared memories, while also revealing a quiet hope that she will continue enjoying life as she grows older. His speech is unhurried, marked by natural pauses and a gentle, almost wistful delivery. The recording is high-fidelity, capturing subtle breaths and the soft rustle of clothing, with no electronic noise or distortion.

At a pivotal moment, a sharp, artificial click signals a hard edit, instantly silencing the natural sounds and transitioning the mood. The environment becomes sterile and studio-like, with a faint electronic hum and a subtle, rhythmic ticking reminiscent of a clock or metronome. A young male voice, processed with heavy reverb, begins to sing in a modern, emotionally charged R&B/Pop style. His voice is clear, smooth, and emotionally vulnerable, with lyrics expressing a resolve to stop self-harm and a desire for personal change. The music is minimal, featuring a soft piano or keyboard, subtle synthesized bass, and ambient electronic pads, creating a spacious and melancholic atmosphere. The vocal performance is marked by a slight pitch instability and a breathy, introspective delivery, further amplifying the sense of vulnerability.

The transition between the two sections is abrupt, emphasizing a contrast between the grounded, real-world intimacy of the first part and the stylized, emotionally charged introspection of the second. The clip concludes with a hard cut, leaving the musical narrative unresolved and evoking a sense of tension and longing.

In summary, the audio presents a carefully constructed narrative: a personal, reflective monologue set in a peaceful natural environment, followed by a sudden shift to a modern, emotionally raw musical segment. The deliberate contrast between the two sections, combined with high-quality production and expressive performances, creates a compelling and evocative listening experience that bridges the real and the imagined.",37.46902494331066,123.046875,77,2416.195147285504,5324.077801899396,0.1049565689862143,-27.017240524291992,250.4298858642578,"[0.2708510160446167, 0.313921719789505, 0.31964486837387085, 0.30473965406417847, 0.2834017872810364, 0.28551992774009705, 0.2894446849822998, 0.2701248526573181, 0.2649376690387726, 0.28176602721214294, 0.29270923137664795, 0.2814376950263977]","[0.3071552515029907, 0.44597360491752625, 0.27005621790885925, 0.23367711901664734, 0.2699432671070099, 0.19564662873744965, 0.17383551597595215, 0.21170645952224731, 0.3501817584037781, 0.30562645196914673, 0.293283611536026, 0.3016493618488312]",2248.1280105194433,1363.1300159637171
9,Best Day of My Life (BUNT. Version),"BUNT., Tom Odell","The audio clip opens with a female vocalist delivering the lyric, “I think today is the best day of my life,” in a clear, bright tone. Her voice is enhanced with heavy digital reverb and a subtle pitch-shifted effect, creating an ethereal, distant quality. This line is accompanied by a steady four-on-the-floor kick drum, a deep sub-bass, and a soft synth pad that fills out the harmonic background. The overall sound is clean and professionally produced, with no ambient noise or live room acoustics.

As the track progresses, the singer continues with “not thinking about the future all the time,” maintaining a relaxed, conversational style. During this section, the phrase “I’m alone, I’m alone, I don’t mind” is repeated, with each “I’m alone” delivered with a slightly altered pitch and rhythm, and each “I don’t mind” sung lower and more slowly. These repetitions, along with a subtle increase in percussion and synth layers, build a sense of introspective melancholy.

The main melodic and lyrical motif is repeated, reinforcing the themes of contentment and solitude. The vocalist then sings, “I’m happy to be alone,” with a gentle, unhurried delivery that further emphasizes the mood of peaceful acceptance.

Midway through, the track introduces a new melodic element: a bright, bell-like synth arpeggio that adds a shimmering texture. The lyrics shift to “through the stars and black black pictures,” delivered in a higher register and with more pronounced reverb, creating a dreamy, expansive atmosphere. The instrumental arrangement remains steady, with a consistent bassline and percussion.

In the closing segment, the singer utters the phrase “one million,” with each word spaced out and trailing into the reverb, leaving a lingering emotional impression. The track ends abruptly, cutting off mid-phrase with no fadeout or resolution, highlighting the unfinished nature of the recording.

Throughout, the production is high-fidelity and modern, with a wide stereo field, prominent sub-bass, and a balanced mix of vocals and instruments. The vocal style is conversational and intimate, supported by electronic textures and effects typical of contemporary indie pop and electronic genres. The lyrics explore themes of present-moment contentment, solitude, and introspection, with no overt references to specific cultural or geographic contexts. The overall mood is melancholic yet accepting, marked by a sense of calm and emotional vulnerability.

In summary, this audio excerpt presents a polished, modern electronic pop track featuring a female vocalist who reflects on solitude and present happiness. The production is clean and atmospheric, with layers of reverb, pitch-shifting, and synth arpeggios that evoke a sense of dreamy introspection. The lyrics and musical arrangement suggest a mood of quiet acceptance, set within a contemporary indie pop context, and the clip concludes with an abrupt cutoff, leaving the listener suspended in unresolved emotion.",39.76780045351474,129.19921875,70,1733.3890810891278,3613.0213321612305,0.0620541903823701,12.98683738708496,156.48997497558594,"[0.34617045521736145, 0.46176794171333313, 0.23468399047851562, 0.2054874747991562, 0.22152306139469147, 0.295943945646286, 0.19079947471618652, 0.24227584898471832, 0.36369243264198303, 0.24907879531383514, 0.28100723028182983, 0.25416508316993713]","[0.291579008102417, 0.40655025839805603, 0.25785696506500244, 0.23401086032390594, 0.2540223002433777, 0.3448585867881775, 0.28762996196746826, 0.2649574875831604, 0.30669504404067993, 0.246424600481987, 0.2800164818763733, 0.2426166981458664]",1863.8829309242176,1553.9192875615893
10,First Time,"Seven Lions, SLANDER, Dabin, Dylan Matthew","The audio clip opens with a dramatic, cinematic soundscape: a swelling, low-frequency synth drone creates a tense, anticipatory atmosphere, accompanied by high-frequency digital textures and a subtle, persistent electronic hiss. This builds suspense as a sharp, synthetic percussive hit signals a transition. Immediately, a modern electronic beat drops—a punchy kick drum, crisp snare, and a syncopated, melodic synth bassline establish the rhythm. The track is characterized by a clean, digital sound, with wide stereo imaging and a polished, studio-produced mix.

A male vocalist enters, singing in English with a soft, breathy, and emotive delivery that blends seamlessly with the music. The vocal is drenched in reverb and delay, giving it a distant, ethereal quality that enhances the atmospheric mood. The lyrics, delivered with emotional clarity, are: “In the darkness, all I see is you.” The vocal melody is simple, descending, and melancholic, emphasizing vulnerability and longing.

Instrumentally, the arrangement is sparse and atmospheric, featuring sustained synth pads, a repeating arpeggiated synth motif, and a melodic, bass-like synth line. These elements, along with the vocal, are centered in the mix, while percussive and atmospheric textures fill out the stereo field. The production is modern and polished, with no audible distortion or analog noise, and a broad frequency range that balances deep bass with sparkling highs.

The emotional tone is introspective and melancholic, with a sense of hope emerging from the darkness, conveyed through both the lyrics and the musical arrangement. The genre blends elements of contemporary Electronic Pop, Chillstep, and Future Bass, with strong cinematic and atmospheric qualities. The music is designed for emotional impact and would suit a film, TV, or video game scene depicting longing, reflection, or a moment of revelation, especially in a modern, urban, or digital context.

In summary, the audio clip presents a high-fidelity, emotionally charged electronic pop track, blending cinematic sound design, modern production, and poignant lyrics to evoke a mood of vulnerability and hope amidst darkness.",36.145487528344674,198.76802884615384,115,1176.7063378796315,2177.7024814848264,0.0492787737837186,-13.244397163391112,214.0255584716797,"[0.2716277539730072, 0.17137818038463593, 0.18075084686279297, 0.27578049898147583, 0.1896207183599472, 0.2770947217941284, 0.5437315702438354, 0.32632309198379517, 0.2059820592403412, 0.1817968785762787, 0.20314475893974304, 0.395609974861145]","[0.2563824951648712, 0.2421531230211258, 0.2266739457845688, 0.3199652135372162, 0.27112266421318054, 0.28771209716796875, 0.31383344531059265, 0.21012535691261292, 0.2564019560813904, 0.2115650326013565, 0.32153552770614624, 0.45722460746765137]",1018.7683401132404,2089.7860983400624
32,Play That Funky Music,Wild Cherry,"The audio clip opens with an instantly recognizable, high-fidelity studio recording of the opening groove from ""Get Up"" by The Red Hot Chili Peppers, a track from their 1989 album *Mother's Milk*. The first moments feature a sharply defined, syncopated bassline played on a clean electric bass, paired with a crisp drum kit—kick, snare, and hi-hats—providing a driving, danceable rhythm. The mix is bright and punchy, with a wide stereo image: the bass and drums are centered, while the rhythm guitar sits slightly right-of-center, all set within a spacious, studio-produced ambiance enhanced by subtle reverb.

At approximately 6.5 seconds in, the lead vocalist—Anthony Kiedis—enters with a raw, energetic, and slightly raspy delivery, singing, ""Hey, you're doing it now, ha ha."" His phrasing is loose and conversational, full of rhythmic playfulness, and is punctuated by a quick, amused laugh. The vocal is mixed slightly left-of-center, and the band continues with its tight, propulsive groove, the rhythm guitar accenting the backbeat and the bass maintaining its driving pulse.

As the performance progresses, Kiedis sings, ""Yeah, hey,"" in a relaxed, conversational tone, followed by, ""Hey, once I was a boogie singer,"" delivered with a touch of self-deprecating humor and a hint of a New York accent. The next lyric, ""Playing in a rock and roll band,"" is sung with a slightly higher pitch and more urgency, reflecting a shift in energy. The following line, ""I never had no problems, yeah,"" is delivered with a casual, almost boastful swagger, and the final phrase, ""Burning down the one-night stands,"" is sung with a growling, gravelly edge that conveys both pride and mischief.

The last lyric, ""Man, everything around me, yeah,"" is sung with a breathy, slightly descending tone, trailing off as the music continues to build momentum. Throughout the clip, the band maintains its tight, energetic rhythm; the bass and drums remain locked in a classic funk-rock style, and the guitar provides percussive stabs and rhythmic accents. The vocals are treated with light reverb, blending naturally with the band's sound. The mix is modern and clear, with no audible background noise, distortion, or artifacts.

The lyrics, delivered with playful swagger, reference the band’s early career and lifestyle, evoking a sense of nostalgia and self-awareness. The musical style is unmistakably funk rock, with elements of classic American rock and roll, and the overall tone is upbeat, celebratory, and full of energy. The performance, both in vocal and instrumental execution, is marked by a sense of spontaneity and confidence, with the vocalist’s delivery and the band’s tight interplay embodying the classic Red Hot Chili Peppers sound of the late 1980s.

In summary, the audio clip is a studio-quality excerpt of The Red Hot Chili Peppers’ ""Get Up,"" capturing its iconic funk-rock groove, playful and self-referential lyrics, and energetic performance. The track’s production, arrangement, and vocal style are emblematic of the band’s classic era, reflecting both their musical influences and their cultural impact within the late 1980s alternative rock scene.",38.9318820861678,107.666015625,66,2272.438125558198,4817.068705277281,0.1089662063953488,1.2974669933319092,180.38232421875,"[0.30777424573898315, 0.27631545066833496, 0.30633166432380676, 0.27799952030181885, 0.37611961364746094, 0.28192460536956787, 0.264519602060318, 0.23393447697162628, 0.2390785813331604, 0.2405620813369751, 0.25295159220695496, 0.36489084362983704]","[0.31966307759284973, 0.31762391328811646, 0.33775606751441956, 0.30826181173324585, 0.29303574562072754, 0.2572937607765198, 0.25264090299606323, 0.22498178482055664, 0.24918566644191742, 0.29206156730651855, 0.27576345205307007, 0.31284642219543457]",1752.5512227387474,2303.521931750498
26,Best Part,"Daniel Caesar, H.E.R.","The audio clip is a professionally produced, intimate R&B/soul ballad performed by a single female vocalist. It opens with a gentle, finger-picked acoustic guitar playing a simple, repeating chord progression (C#m7, G#m7, F#m7, Bmaj7), accompanied by a soft electronic drum machine or programmed beat. The beat consists of a muted kick drum, a subtle snare/clap with reverb, and delicate hi-hats, all mixed to create a warm, enveloping, and slightly spacious sound. The production is clean and modern, with subtle effects: the guitar is drenched in lush reverb, the vocals are close-mic’d and treated with light reverb and gentle delay, and the bass is understated but present.

From the outset, the mood is tender, introspective, and romantic, underscored by the vocalist’s breathy, emotionally nuanced delivery. The singer begins with a soft, wordless “Ohh” and “Hey,” establishing a mood of vulnerability and anticipation. She then sings, “You don’t know babe, when you hold me and kiss me slowly, it’s the sweetest thing,” with a tone that is both confessional and deeply affectionate. The lyrics and musical phrasing reinforce the theme of quiet intimacy, with a focus on the physical and emotional closeness of the relationship.

Throughout the song, the arrangement remains minimal and unobtrusive, letting the singer’s voice and the guitar melody take center stage. The vocalist’s phrasing is fluid, with expressive timing and subtle dynamic shifts that convey sincerity. The use of “babe” and the romantic, slow-tempo delivery are classic signifiers of contemporary R&B and soul, and the production values further align with modern, high-quality indie-pop ballads.

Near the end, the singer softly intones, “And if I had it my way, you would know that you are…” before the audio cuts off abruptly, leaving the final word incomplete. The sudden ending suggests the clip is either an excerpt from a longer track or a deliberately unfinished segment.

No other instruments, background vocals, or ambient noises are present, and the recording is free from technical artifacts such as hiss, hum, or distortion. The overall effect is a deeply personal, emotionally resonant musical vignette, blending elements of contemporary R&B, soul, and indie-folk to evoke the feeling of a private, heartfelt confession.",39.16408163265306,143.5546875,97,1794.3206881883825,3979.966488913382,0.05749880751704209,-6.19317102432251,208.91873168945312,"[0.2539973855018616, 0.43778136372566223, 0.35420483350753784, 0.27998828887939453, 0.34637171030044556, 0.21758797764778137, 0.21572506427764893, 0.23195314407348633, 0.3186309337615967, 0.2915743291378021, 0.2284388542175293, 0.1832900047302246]","[0.18230418860912323, 0.2538737952709198, 0.3231220841407776, 0.2129787802696228, 0.1510211080312729, 0.15981058776378632, 0.31385716795921326, 0.5526069402694702, 0.3609228730201721, 0.2860908806324005, 0.2176428586244583, 0.20207984745502472]",1337.2786858696247,1793.9358806491068
27,2008,Rex Orange County,"The audio clip begins in a quiet, controlled studio setting, marked by a subtle, steady electronic hiss that underscores the high-fidelity recording. An acoustic guitar, fingerpicked with a clean, modern tone, introduces the piece with a repeating arpeggiated pattern, supported by a soft, deep kick drum and a synthesized bassline that establishes a calm, introspective mood. The guitar’s bright, reverb-drenched sound is panned slightly to the left, while the bass and drums anchor the center of the stereo field.

A female vocalist enters with a soft, breathy, and slightly melancholic delivery, singing the word ""Lord"" in a descending, melodic line. Her voice, marked by a gentle vibrato and a subtle reverb, is panned to the right. This phrase is repeated, each time subtly varied with a slight shift in pitch and a nuanced breathiness, while the guitar, bass, and drums maintain their understated groove. The atmosphere is intimate and contemplative, with the sparse instrumentation highlighting the vulnerability of the vocal performance.

As the piece progresses, the female vocalist continues with the lyric, ""Oh, I'm in my bag, I'm always driving 'round..."" Her voice remains breathy and expressive, and the arrangement gradually gains depth. The bass becomes more pronounced, and the kick drum remains steady, providing a subtle pulse. The guitar continues its melodic loop, and a new, soft electronic pad emerges, adding warmth and atmosphere to the mix. The lyrics suggest themes of independence, self-assurance, and a sense of purpose, delivered with a tone of gentle reflection.

The arrangement intensifies further, with the female vocals becoming more assertive and confident, while the instrumental layers build in complexity. The bassline grows more active, and the drum pattern incorporates additional percussive elements, enhancing the groove. A male vocalist joins, singing ""Free your mind and treat it kindly"" in a clear, warm tenor with a slight vibrato and reverb, panned to the left. The female vocalist responds in harmony, creating a call-and-response dynamic that enriches the emotional texture. The lyrics shift from personal introspection to a broader, communal message of self-care and mental liberation, delivered with a sense of unity and uplift.

The song reaches its emotional peak as both voices sing in harmony, their lines overlapping and blending. The arrangement becomes the most layered, with drums, bass, guitar, electronic pad, and vocals all contributing to a rich, immersive soundscape. The female vocalist’s final word, ""kindly,"" lingers, supported by a sustained pad and gentle reverb, and the clip concludes with a sense of resolution and peace.

28,Gata Only,"FloyyMenor, Cris MJ","The audio clip begins with a soft, atmospheric synthesizer pad, immediately immersing the listener in a modern Latin urban soundscape. The pad’s sustained, melancholic tone is enveloped in lush reverb and subtle stereo effects, creating a sense of spaciousness and emotional depth. A gentle, high-pitched, bell-like arpeggio emerges, its metallic timbre and digital reverb enhancing the introspective mood. Soon after, a warm, rounded synth bass enters, playing a simple, descending four-note motif that grounds the arrangement. This is accompanied by a crisp, synthetic percussion element—a steady, high-frequency click—that adds rhythmic drive, subtly panned left and right to produce a wide stereo image.

As the instrumental builds, a subtle, low-frequency shaker or hi-hat joins, panned hard right, providing additional rhythmic texture. The pad swells in volume, and the arpeggio cycles through its pattern, establishing a loop that repeats and deepens the atmospheric foundation. The bass continues its steady, descending motif, while the percussion maintains a consistent, understated rhythm. The overall mood remains contemplative and emotionally charged, with the sound design emphasizing spaciousness and introspection.

At a pivotal moment, a male voice—close-mic’d and dry—enters with a soft, breathy “Hey,” serving as a subtle vocal cue. This is followed by a second male vocal, delivered in a relaxed, melodic style with a Puerto Rican accent and characteristic “seseo.” The lyrics are sung in Spanish, beginning with “Mami, te siento lejos, dime dónde estás,” expressing longing and intimacy. The vocal’s rhythm is syncopated and conversational, accompanied by a simple, descending synth motif that underscores the emotional plea. The singer continues with “Te quiero chingarte, voy a rastarte, déjate llevar, apaga el celular,” blending direct romantic language with a sense of urgency and desire. The delivery remains smooth and melodic, with a sense of vulnerability and closeness.

As the mood intensifies, the singer adds “Porque si estás conmigo, no te va a pasar nada,” affirming reassurance and comfort. The instrumental supports the emotional progression, with the pad swelling and the bass maintaining its steady pattern. The vocal then shifts to a more rhythmic, almost spoken-word delivery: “Solo déjate llevar, ten la mente atenta a la jugada,” emphasizing surrender and focus. The instrumental continues to evolve, with the pad and bass cycling in tandem, and the percussion maintaining its steady, understated rhythm.

The singer’s tone becomes more assertive and rhythmic: “Y yo quiero contigo y tú quieres conmigo,” highlighting mutual desire and connection. The instrumental remains consistent, with the pad and bass repeating their motifs and the percussion providing a steady pulse. The clip concludes with the singer’s final line, “Te voy a dar lo que tú necesitas,” delivered in a clear, melodic style, reinforcing the theme of fulfillment and emotional intimacy. The instrumental fades out as the vocal finishes, with the pad, bass, and percussion all resolving in a seamless, atmospheric conclusion.

Throughout the clip, the audio is of high fidelity, with no noise or distortion and a well-balanced mix. The vocals are dry and intimate, contrasting with the reverb-drenched instrumental elements. The spatial arrangement is deliberate, with pads filling the center, arpeggios and percussion panned for width, and the vocal centered and close. The song’s structure is cyclical and loop-based, typical of contemporary Latin urban music, with a moderate tempo and a melancholic, emotional mood. The lyrics focus on longing, reassurance, desire, and mutual connection, delivered in a relaxed, melodic style with a Puerto Rican accent. The cultural context is rooted in Latin urban genres such as Latin Trap or Reggaeton, with modern production techniques and a bilingual, cosmopolitan feel.

In summary, the audio clip presents a richly layered, emotionally resonant excerpt of Latin urban music, blending atmospheric synths, subtle percussion, and intimate Spanish vocals. The production emphasizes clarity, spatial depth, and emotional nuance, with lyrics expressing longing, reassurance, and desire. The style and delivery are emblematic of contemporary Latin Trap or Reggaeton, reflecting both personal connection and modern musical aesthetics.",39.83746031746032,99.38401442307692,38,1342.333803731156,2720.4366190450173,0.051663912259615384,6.242983341217041,181.24844360351562,"[0.2444583624601364, 0.2624947726726532, 0.20559139549732208, 0.3985469341278076, 0.2929779291152954, 0.22384972870349884, 0.29273608326911926, 0.2469097375869751, 0.3993072211742401, 0.21760977804660797, 0.2652745842933655, 0.3323470950126648]","[0.24042074382305145, 0.33812880516052246, 0.30342981219291687, 0.38281503319740295, 0.2547362446784973, 0.29720690846443176, 0.2474946826696396, 0.18364989757537842, 0.24945589900016785, 0.20866382122039795, 0.35711631178855896, 0.3282460570335388]",644.2597027064336,1469.682144598887
29,Tennessee Whiskey,Chris Stapleton,"The audio clip begins with a brief, high-fidelity introduction featuring a clean electric guitar riff, a steady drum beat, and a prominent, melodic bassline, establishing a classic blues-rock groove. The sound is polished, with a balanced mix and subtle studio reverb, evoking the atmosphere of a well-produced late-1960s to mid-1970s recording. As the instrumental section progresses, a male vocalist enters, singing in a deep, soulful baritone with a pronounced Southern American accent. His delivery is marked by a relaxed, weary tone, and the lyrics—“Used to spend my nights out in a barroom...” and “Liquor was the only love I've known...”—are delivered with expressive phrasing and a touch of melancholy, emphasizing the emotional weight of the words. The instrumentation remains consistent and supportive throughout, with the guitar and bass maintaining their central roles and the drums providing a steady, unobtrusive backbeat. The clip ends abruptly, mid-phrase, cutting off the final word “known” with a hard digital edit, suggesting this is an excerpt from a longer recording rather than a complete performance.

This audio excerpt presents a classic American blues-rock style, blending elements of Southern rock and soulful vocals with a modern production quality. The narrative conveyed through the lyrics centers on the themes of nightlife, alcohol, and emotional reflection, and the music’s arrangement and vocal delivery evoke the traditions of 1970s American roots rock, while the clean, contemporary sound places it within a modern context. The abrupt ending further highlights the excerpted nature of the clip, leaving the listener with a sense of ongoing story and unresolved emotion.",39.74458049886621,151.99908088235293,100,1573.2534998393999,3383.2598962516427,0.04905087479921145,-6.631507396697998,215.17184448242188,"[0.2525172829627991, 0.31630706787109375, 0.27424171566963196, 0.306917279958725, 0.3252600431442261, 0.25620514154434204, 0.2528306543827057, 0.26767081022262573, 0.3266911804676056, 0.31419628858566284, 0.293844074010849, 0.2607322037220001]","[0.25745299458503723, 0.3608512580394745, 0.31386125087738037, 0.2362058460712433, 0.29404690861701965, 0.2529902160167694, 0.2746732831001282, 0.25063854455947876, 0.30238085985183716, 0.3321657180786133, 0.2866743505001068, 0.2766207456588745]",2035.439244466728,1249.7923275063706
30,She’s Always a Woman,Billy Joel,"The audio clip begins with a slow, expressive piano introduction, featuring a minor-key progression in G minor, accompanied by lush, synthesized string pads. This creates a somber, cinematic atmosphere, with each note of the piano’s arpeggiated chords carefully articulated and enveloped in reverb, setting a reflective mood. The piano continues steadily, maintaining its minor harmony and dynamic swells, while the synthesized strings add a sustained, orchestral backdrop. As the music unfolds, a male vocalist enters, singing in a clear, gentle baritone with a distinctly North American accent. His delivery is smooth and controlled, marked by subtle vibrato and nuanced phrasing, emphasizing emotional depth. The lyrics describe a woman’s dual nature: “She can kill with a smile, she can wound with her eyes. She can ruin your faith with her casual lies. And she only reveals what she wants you to see.” The piano and strings support the vocals, with the piano’s rhythm becoming more syncopated and the strings swelling to heighten the emotional resonance. The vocalist continues: “She hides like a child, but she’s always a woman to me.” The instrumentation remains steady, and the vocal performance is marked by a soft, heartfelt delivery, with the piano’s left hand providing a simple, supportive bass line. A brief pause follows, during which the piano holds a sustained chord and the strings gently fade. The vocalist resumes, now with a slightly brighter tone: “She can lead you to love, she can take you or leave it.” The piano’s rhythm grows more pronounced, and the strings intensify, building emotional tension. The final lyric, “She can ask for the truth, but she’ll...”, is delivered with increasing urgency, culminating in a strong, sustained vocal note on “she’ll.” The music and vocals swell together, then abruptly cut off mid-phrase, leaving the listener suspended in unresolved emotion.

This audio is a high-fidelity studio recording of a classic pop/soft rock ballad, featuring a male vocalist with a North American accent and expertly arranged piano and synthesized strings. The lyrics poetically explore a woman’s complexity and the emotional impact of her dual nature, delivered in a style reminiscent of 1970s/80s American pop ballads. The production is polished and emotionally resonant, with every instrument and vocal nuance carefully crafted to evoke intimacy, longing, and unresolved tension.",39.28018140589569,172.265625,112,1460.0144800620344,2666.101983252992,0.06798133218823878,-16.52137565612793,246.50526428222656,"[0.1898476481437683, 0.1942661702632904, 0.32677245140075684, 0.2729557156562805, 0.17680320143699646, 0.3407905101776123, 0.22533686459064484, 0.34830689430236816, 0.3084772527217865, 0.2561427652835846, 0.45278865098953247, 0.2442469745874405]","[0.24207735061645508, 0.19414681196212769, 0.2730616629123688, 0.2623518705368042, 0.2510005831718445, 0.3376345932483673, 0.22638221085071564, 0.3294830322265625, 0.28287532925605774, 0.28682973980903625, 0.42102906107902527, 0.28974631428718567]",1055.9928723210774,1522.6713087770681
31,Luck Pusher,FINNEAS,"The audio clip begins with a solo acoustic guitar playing a gentle, fingerstyle arpeggiated pattern in the key of A major. The guitar’s sound is warm, intimate, and closely recorded, featuring a subtle, natural room reverb and a faint background hiss, characteristic of a home studio environment. The melody is played in the higher register, while the lower strings provide a steady, rhythmic bass foundation. The music is soft, mellow, and unaccompanied, creating a calm, introspective, and emotionally neutral atmosphere.

Shortly after the guitar establishes its pattern, a male vocalist enters, singing in a clear, gentle baritone with a slightly raspy timbre. His delivery is soft, breathy, and emotionally subdued, reflecting a style common in contemporary singer-songwriter and indie folk music. The vocal phrasing is slow and deliberate, with a slight emphasis on the words “again,” “that’s,” and “always,” and a noticeable pitch bend on “for you and me,” all delivered with natural, unforced articulation. The lyrics, in General American English, are: “On again, off again, that’s the way it’s always been for you and me.” The vocal is recorded with a short, natural room reverb and is tightly centered in the mix, with no other instruments or background sounds present.

The guitar continues to accompany the vocals with the same gentle, arpeggiated pattern, supporting the emotional tone of the lyrics. After the first verse, the music and vocals pause briefly, leaving a moment of silence that emphasizes the reflective nature of the passage.

The second verse begins with the vocalist singing, “Fall in love, fall apart, draw the circle till you start to see.” His voice remains soft and breathy, with a slightly lower pitch and a subtle vibrato on the word “see.” The guitar maintains its simple, unobtrusive pattern throughout, with no added instrumentation or embellishment. The music and vocals end abruptly, cutting off mid-phrase, suggesting the clip is a segment from a longer, unfinished composition.

The recording is of high fidelity, with clean separation between voice and guitar and no technical errors such as clipping or distortion. The sound is intimate and focused, with no background noise apart from a faint hiss and natural room reverb. The emotional tone is melancholic and introspective, reflecting themes of cyclical relationships and emotional complexity. The style, vocal technique, and production are typical of contemporary indie folk and singer-songwriter genres, evoking artists like Iron & Wine and Bon Iver. The lyrics and musical choices suggest a personal, confessional mood, with the abrupt ending hinting at an unfinished or demo-like recording.

In summary, the clip presents a brief, intimate musical vignette featuring a solo acoustic guitar and gentle, emotionally expressive male vocals. The lyrics explore the recurring patterns of love and separation, delivered in a soft, reflective tone. The recording is high-quality, with natural reverb and no extraneous sounds, reflecting the aesthetics of modern indie folk and singer-songwriter music. The abrupt ending and lack of additional instrumentation suggest it is a fragment of a longer, unfinished work.",39.95356009070295,129.19921875,86,1340.513776469919,2849.4458532693566,0.04934591307742592,5.710488319396973,201.984130859375,"[0.14830617606639862, 0.4031984508037567, 0.13596531748771667, 0.18077057600021362, 0.40736785531044006, 0.26030033826828003, 0.34955236315727234, 0.19565923511981964, 0.29030030965805054, 0.4530010223388672, 0.2582534849643707, 0.11797675490379333]","[0.2454792708158493, 0.26869165897369385, 0.18181906640529633, 0.2797170579433441, 0.41060179471969604, 0.27061817049980164, 0.30977752804756165, 0.1789538413286209, 0.19960710406303406, 0.27252504229545593, 0.3036326766014099, 0.4244108498096466]",859.2847279811106,1586.0203599229162
