1,s.o.s,"jigitz, Tabi","The audio clip begins with a close-mic’d, intimate female vocal, singing in a clear, breathy tone with a slight melancholy, accompanied by a gently arpeggiated piano. The vocal melody is “S-O-S, someone said, never gonna let you down, found you in every crowd.” The recording features natural room reverberation and a faint analog-style hiss, with no other instruments present, creating an emotionally resonant, vulnerable atmosphere. The vocal performance is precise and emotionally expressive, with a subtle vibrato on the word “down.”

This section is abruptly cut off, followed by a brief silence, then a dramatic shift to a high-energy electronic dance track. The new section features a deep, pulsing bassline, crisp electronic drum beat, and a synthesized pad. The vocals return, now processed with heavy reverb and delay, delivering the lines: “To you, if I’m reaching out, it’s for you, if I’m going down, it’s for you, if I’m singing out, it’s for you.” These lyrics are sung in a more detached, ethereal style, reflecting the emotional transition from vulnerability to cathartic release.

As the song continues, the original piano and vocal motif returns, now remixed and integrated into the dance structure. The lyrics “S-O-S, someone said, never gonna let you down, found you in every crowd” are repeated, but this time the vocal is treated with heavy reverb and delay, blending into the dense, club-ready production. The arrangement now features a driving four-on-the-floor beat, wide stereo synth pads, and a heavily side-chained bass, all characteristic of modern progressive house or electro house. The mood is both euphoric and emotionally charged, with a sense of communal release.

The audio ends abruptly in the midst of the final vocal phrase, cutting off before the musical resolution, likely an artifact of the excerpt.

The recording is of high fidelity, with a broad frequency spectrum and clear stereo imaging. The mix is dynamic and well-balanced, shifting from an intimate, lo-fi ambiance to a polished, high-energy electronic production. The lyrics center on themes of distress, connection, and emotional support, with “S-O-S” serving as both a literal and metaphorical plea. The structure and sound design reflect the conventions of contemporary dance music, with a clear progression from vulnerability to catharsis. The absence of crowd or environmental sounds, combined with studio techniques and production choices, suggests the clip is a studio excerpt intended for broadcast, streaming, or promotional use, rather than a live performance.

In summary, this audio clip is a meticulously produced segment of a modern dance-pop song that transitions from an emotionally raw, piano-based intro to a high-energy electronic dance remix. It showcases the genre’s signature elements—vocal processing, driving rhythms, and a blend of vulnerability and euphoria—while highlighting the central theme of seeking and offering support during times of emotional crisis.",39.67492063492063,135.99917763157896,89,1741.8599646702646,3462.7003410254533,0.0694636506180514,4.362417221069336,168.33628845214844,"[0.24323435127735138, 0.35011112689971924, 0.29682570695877075, 0.3084580600261688, 0.36326953768730164, 0.24954168498516083, 0.24548128247261047, 0.22966806590557098, 0.36281707882881165, 0.32698893547058105, 0.20004558563232422, 0.2217811644077301]","[0.265908420085907, 0.32140180468559265, 0.31037628650665283, 0.3016101121902466, 0.29139071702957153, 0.24112668633460999, 0.23919302225112915, 0.25638309121131897, 0.344652384519577, 0.34412041306495667, 0.26693058013916016, 0.25345444679260254]",1777.7545825507957,2461.514592573929
2,tell you straight (Ely Oaks’ version),"jigitz, Ely Oaks","The audio clip opens with a gentle, sustained piano chord, its notes ringing softly into the ambient space. A subtle, high-frequency synth pad adds a shimmering backdrop, while a barely-there, low-frequency hum grounds the mix. The atmosphere is intimate and melancholic, setting a reflective mood. A female vocalist enters, her voice clear, breathy, and emotionally nuanced, delivered with a contemporary American accent. She sings, “You think I'm gonna fall in love when I'm not, babe,” her tone shifting from wistful to assertive, emphasizing the word “not.” The lyrics continue with “You want a life as a wife, but that's not my name,” delivered with a rising inflection and a touch of defiance. The next lines, “You been at home all alone, looking at the rain,” are sung with a plaintive quality, evoking a sense of longing and isolation. The final phrase, “I'm just gonna tell you straight, baby I will...,” is delivered with heightened clarity and confidence, the word “baby” trailing off into the next musical section.

As the vocals end, the instrumental abruptly transitions to a high-energy electronic dance groove. The piano chords are replaced by a deep, resonant synthesized bassline, a four-on-the-floor kick drum, and a syncopated, bright synth lead. The tempo is fast, and the mix is dense, with all elements tightly compressed for maximum impact. This section features a rapid, processed vocal sample—“baby I will”—which becomes a rhythmic hook, repeating in a chopped, stuttering fashion. The sample is manipulated with a filter sweep, creating a dynamic rise and fall in intensity, and is layered with a high-pitched, descending synth motif. The phrase “baby I will” is repeated multiple times, each instance accompanied by variations in filter and rhythm, maintaining the energetic, dancefloor-oriented mood.

The clip concludes with a return to the initial piano motif, now slightly altered and isolated, as the electronic elements fade out. The final moments feature a gentle, high-pitched synth flourish before the audio abruptly ends, leaving a lingering sense of emotional contrast.

In summary, the audio clip is a meticulously produced, emotionally charged electronic dance track that blends introspective lyrics and atmospheric vocals with a high-energy, club-ready instrumental. The production utilizes modern EDM techniques—layered synths, processed vocal samples, and dynamic filter sweeps—to create a track that is both personally expressive and suitable for dance environments. The lyrics, delivered in clear American English, focus on themes of independence, rejection, and emotional clarity, all underscored by the stark contrast between the intimate opening and the driving dance section. The absence of crowd or environmental sounds, combined with studio-quality mixing and mastering, suggests a contemporary, mainstream pop/dance release intended for broad appeal.",39.51238095238095,161.4990234375,95,2239.818487868035,4909.962515377129,0.0810211217501468,21.587995529174805,118.28024291992188,"[0.34939044713974, 0.257163405418396, 0.27419039607048035, 0.23305194079875946, 0.29991570115089417, 0.3772229254245758, 0.253389835357666, 0.317667156457901, 0.25109028816223145, 0.3504992425441742, 0.21488887071609497, 0.22991527616977692]","[0.3123464286327362, 0.25357958674430847, 0.26476597785949707, 0.2425500899553299, 0.29862838983535767, 0.31084713339805603, 0.22877071797847748, 0.2690137028694153, 0.26502129435539246, 0.37119799852371216, 0.32441580295562744, 0.29227784276008606]",1918.3365588225215,2231.418444593265
3,Too Late,Shankz,"The audio clip is a high-fidelity, professionally produced segment of a contemporary electronic dance music track, blending elements of future bass and modern pop. The song is performed by a female vocalist with a clear, breathy, and emotionally charged delivery, characterized by a distinctly American accent and a tone that is both vulnerable and assertive. Her voice is processed with lush reverb and subtle delay, placing her centrally in the mix and enveloping her in a spacious, atmospheric soundstage.

The musical arrangement features a prominent, melodic four-on-the-floor kick drum, crisp and syncopated hi-hats, and a deep sub-bass that underpins the emotional core of the track. A recurring, shimmering synth arpeggio cycles throughout, punctuated by a short, ascending melodic motif. The production is clean and modern, with no extraneous noise, and features subtle digital artifacts only in the most dynamic moments.

Lyrically, the song centers on a repeated, accusatory phrase: “You say too late to start,” which is repeated in a looping, chant-like fashion. Additional lines include “You know you better,” “I don’t believe in anything,” and “You say too late to start with your heart in a...” (the last phrase cut off abruptly at the end of the clip). The lyrics are delivered in a manner that suggests a confrontation or emotional reckoning, with the vocalist’s tone shifting from plaintive to defiant as the song progresses.

The structure of the clip is built around a repetitive vocal hook, with the main phrase “You say too late to start” serving as both the thematic and melodic anchor. The arrangement builds in intensity, with layers of synths, percussion, and vocal harmonies gradually added. The emotional arc culminates in a more assertive, almost defiant tone during the final lines, before the track is abruptly truncated mid-word, leaving a sense of unresolved tension.

The overall style and production point to a 2010s–2020s EDM/pop context, drawing on the conventions of future bass and mainstream dance music, with an emphasis on emotional resonance, polished sound design, and a blend of vulnerability and empowerment in the vocal performance. The absence of any spoken word, crowd noise, or environmental sounds confirms this as a studio-produced track, likely intended for radio, streaming, or club play.",40.0,66.25600961538461,42,3150.711582781177,6269.898863718804,0.1788512156304411,3.482253074645996,92.0329360961914,"[0.2134319543838501, 0.3322238624095917, 0.22807732224464417, 0.20472180843353271, 0.24561767280101776, 0.33012837171554565, 0.3361464738845825, 0.30279794335365295, 0.4283985197544098, 0.2966333031654358, 0.24177882075309753, 0.2148866355419159]","[0.2611657679080963, 0.2879611551761627, 0.25133025646209717, 0.24680782854557037, 0.28314080834388733, 0.25916075706481934, 0.31796491146087646, 0.28691431879997253, 0.34913018345832825, 0.331864595413208, 0.2758079469203949, 0.29315388202667236]",3569.0744055889004,3026.512428908748
4,"Better Off (Alone, Pt. III)","Alan Walker, Dash Berlin, Vikkstar","The audio clip begins with a full, energetic dance-pop instrumental, characterized by a bright, arpeggiated synthesizer melody, a deep and driving electronic drum beat (four-on-the-floor kick, sharp snare, crisp hi-hats), and a lush, wide stereo mix. The production is modern, with pronounced use of reverb and delay on the vocals and synths, creating a spacious and immersive atmosphere. The mix is clean and well-balanced, with a low-frequency sub-bass foundation, midrange synths and vocals, and bright, crisp highs.

At the 00:07 mark, the female vocalist enters with a breathy, slightly processed tone and a confident, emotionally charged delivery. Her accent is a General American English, with a subtle hint of Southern US inflection, and her performance is marked by a controlled vibrato and a slightly raspy quality. She sings the following lyrics:

""This could be a good night for good times, and you look like a good time. We're dancing to dancing in the moonlight. Now I want you back. Can you make me feel better?""

After a brief instrumental break, the chorus repeats verbatim. Throughout, the vocal track is layered with harmonies and ad-libs, including a repeated ""back"" at the end of the chorus, adding depth and emotional emphasis. The instrumental arrangement remains consistent, with the same synth, drum, and bass elements, and the production continues to showcase wide stereo imaging and dynamic compression typical of contemporary dance-pop.

At the end of the second chorus, the vocals abruptly cut off mid-word, leaving only the instrumental, which continues with the same energy and sonic character. There are no ambient sounds, crowd noises, or additional vocalizations; the focus is solely on the song’s performance and production.

The clip is a high-fidelity, modern pop/dance-pop track, likely from the late 2010s or 2020s. It features an upbeat, danceable instrumental foundation and emotionally charged lyrics about longing and connection. The production is polished and contemporary, with no regional or cultural identifiers beyond the General American English vocal style and the stylistic hallmarks of mainstream Western pop.

5,If You Let Me,"Albi, Sinéad Harnett","The audio clip begins with a female vocalist singing in a high, breathy register, her voice reverberating over a slow, melancholic piano melody. The lyrics, “hurts me the most when I wait,” are delivered with a tone of quiet sorrow and vulnerability, setting a somber mood. The piano chords are sustained and spacious, enveloped in reverb, while a faint, sustained synth pad adds atmospheric depth. The vocal is mixed to the forefront, with subtle reverb and a hint of digital delay, establishing a sense of emotional isolation.

As the music progresses, the piano maintains its reflective mood while a subtle, syncopated electronic drum beat enters, marked by a soft kick, a steady electronic snare/clap, and a crisp, high-frequency closed hi-hat. The vocalist continues with, “I fumble and twist,” her voice conveying emotional turbulence. The next line, “till the truth starts to click,” is accompanied by a slight increase in vocal intensity, suggesting a moment of realization. The piano and synth pad continue to provide harmonic support.

A new phrase, “There’s so much space in this bed,” is delivered with a sense of emptiness, enhanced by the wide stereo spread of the instruments. The singer’s voice remains centered and intimate, while the piano and synths fill the soundstage. The next line, “These sheets go for miles,” is sung with a breathy quality, and the instrumental arrangement remains sparse and atmospheric.

The mood shifts as the vocalist sings, “Dreams of your smile,” with a slight lift in emotional energy, hinting at hope. This is immediately followed by, “I don’t wanna be just a memory,” where the vocal intensity increases, and the arrangement subtly builds in anticipation.

The chorus begins with a marked change in the instrumental landscape: the drumbeat becomes more pronounced and dance-oriented, featuring a four-on-the-floor kick, crisp snare/clap, and a syncopated hi-hat pattern. The bassline enters with a melodic, syncopated motif, reinforcing the electronic, club-ready feel. The female vocalist belts out, “And I don’t wanna feel your lips break free,” her voice now more powerful and layered with harmonies, while the piano transitions to a staccato, rhythmic chord pattern. The chorus continues with, “Because without you I’m lost in the breeze,” as the arrangement grows more dense and energetic, and the vocals become even more intense.

The next phrase, “I gotta be strong now,” is delivered with a strong, determined tone, matching the rising intensity of the instrumental. The following line, “I gotta show you how I love you like I’ve never ever loved somebody,” is sung with heightened emotion and a sense of urgency, as the track approaches its peak. The bassline remains central, and the drums drive the energy forward.

The final section features the lyric, “I’ll give you things you didn’t even know you wanted,” delivered with a sense of confidence and emotional climax. The arrangement is at its most intense, with the bassline and drums driving the momentum. The next line, “Don’t tell me that it’s not enough,” is sung with a pleading, urgent tone, while the drums and bass continue their rhythmic interplay. The last phrase, “My time is up, you’re over us,” is delivered with a resigned finality, and the track begins to fade out, with the bassline, drums, and vocals gradually diminishing.

The recording exhibits high fidelity, with a full frequency range, clear separation of elements, and a well-balanced stereo image. The vocal is centered and intimate, while the piano, synths, bass, and drums fill the stereo field. The production features lush reverb and delay on the vocals and synths, and a compressed, punchy mix. The emotional tone shifts from vulnerability and longing to intensity and urgency, reflecting the song’s narrative arc. The lyrics explore themes of heartbreak, desire, and self-assertion, and the arrangement transitions from sparse, melancholic piano to a dynamic, dance-oriented electronic sound. The absence of audience noise, crowd sounds, or environmental cues confirms a studio setting, with the arrangement and production style characteristic of contemporary pop and electronic dance music.

In summary, the audio is a polished studio recording that blends emotive, English-language vocals with a dynamic electronic arrangement, moving from introspective vulnerability to a powerful, danceable climax. The lyrics express longing and heartbreak, and the production delivers a modern pop/electronic sound with high technical quality and emotional impact.",39.907120181405894,92.28515625,61,2277.7985640420434,4657.873599067409,0.0857554242110238,24.20309257507324,119.09190368652344,"[0.27365851402282715, 0.2982649505138397, 0.42210152745246887, 0.3090893626213074, 0.24754637479782104, 0.27060118317604065, 0.26983100175857544, 0.27230849862098694, 0.2641909718513489, 0.3117425739765167, 0.24583539366722107, 0.23143655061721802]","[0.26563018560409546, 0.2903241813182831, 0.36749351024627686, 0.3132982850074768, 0.29524385929107666, 0.26356881856918335, 0.2489837259054184, 0.3218807578086853, 0.2950636148452759, 0.2817235291004181, 0.23140107095241547, 0.26406529545783997]",1873.101583402689,2382.466411113846
6,Don't Forget My Love,"Diplo, Miguel","The audio clip is a professionally produced, high-fidelity excerpt from a contemporary pop/dance track, likely originating from the late 2010s or early 2020s. It opens with a brief ambient soundscape—soft, steady rain and a low, distant rumble of thunder—evoking a mood of introspection and emotional vulnerability. This atmospheric introduction, free of human noise, sets a contemplative tone.

At around five seconds, the rain and thunder are joined by a male vocalist who enters with a smooth, clear, and emotive tenor voice. The lyrics are delivered in English with a General American accent, and the vocal style is marked by a blend of melodic singing and gentle, rhythmic spoken-word inflections. The voice is treated with a lush reverb and subtle delay, creating a sense of space and intimacy, as though the singer is singing from within the listener’s own head.

The musical arrangement is built on a foundation of electronic elements: a steady four-on-the-floor kick drum, crisp hi-hats, a warm, rounded synth bass, and layers of lush, atmospheric pads. The chord progression is simple and consonant, in a major key, reinforcing the track’s emotional, romantic tone. A recurring, high-pitched arpeggiated synth motif provides additional texture and rhythmic interest. The production is polished and modern, with all elements clearly separated in the stereo field and an overall clean, spacious mix.

As the song progresses, the vocal and instrumental layers gradually intensify, building toward a climactic moment. The lyrics focus on themes of memory, intimacy, and longing, with phrases such as “Remember the feeling of my fingertips on your skin,” “the way that I kiss is taste sweeter after drinking,” and “just so you can feel me with your way when I'm not around.” These lines, delivered with a gentle urgency, evoke the physical and emotional closeness of a romantic relationship, tinged with a sense of absence and yearning.

The track’s structure follows a typical pop format, with a build-up in intensity and a brief, anticipatory pause before the final, emotionally charged line: “Don’t forget my love.” This phrase is delivered with heightened emotion and is immediately followed by a hard, abrupt cut to silence, leaving the listener with a sense of unresolved tension.

No extraneous sounds—such as speech, environmental noise, or crowd effects—appear at any point. The only non-musical elements are the initial rain and thunder, which fade out as the song begins.

In summary, the clip is a short, emotionally charged, and atmospheric segment from a modern pop/dance song, designed to evoke intimacy, longing, and romantic memory through its lyrics, vocal delivery, and carefully crafted electronic arrangement. The production is high-quality, and the overall mood is one of reflective longing, culminating in a powerful emotional crescendo and an abrupt, unresolved ending.",39.95356009070295,123.046875,83,2450.163873590703,5717.127989836033,0.0878795599397152,-0.4669432640075683,160.24560546875,"[0.277237206697464, 0.27670350670814514, 0.28784316778182983, 0.2990938723087311, 0.2941589057445526, 0.285501629114151, 0.2811618745326996, 0.28462308645248413, 0.286396861076355, 0.2867012321949005, 0.30651193857192993, 0.2966320514678955]","[0.2878628969192505, 0.32481473684310913, 0.3056904971599579, 0.24267011880874634, 0.2549866735935211, 0.24569720029830933, 0.3159325122833252, 0.2490423023700714, 0.2669106423854828, 0.33959534764289856, 0.28020787239074707, 0.32709550857543945]",2129.7256760298355,1803.9837049772475
7,Replay (with Dylan Matthew),"SLANDER, Dylan Matthew","The audio clip opens with a lush, modern electronic soundscape, dominated by a deep, synthesized bassline, atmospheric pads, and a subtle, high-frequency shaker. The production is clean, with no ambient noise or imperfections, and the stereo field is wide, placing the listener within a spacious, digitally constructed environment. This instrumental foundation is immediately evocative of contemporary pop, R&B, and electronic genres, with clear influences from late-2010s and early-2020s trends.

At the four-second mark, a male vocalist enters with a soft, breathy, and emotionally vulnerable tone. He sings the phrase, “If I could face you,” which is immediately followed by a second, nearly identical line, both delivered in a manner that is intimate and introspective. These lines are sung with a gentle, melodic contour, and the vocal is enveloped in a lush reverb, blending seamlessly with the instrumental bed.

The main lyrical section begins at 00:12, with the singer reflecting on a past relationship: “Do you remember those days when we thought we had it all? Such young love, but so incapable. We lost our innocence in the back of that car. I didn’t know that you would take it this far. So I sat back on that couch and I watched you fix your hair and I made you—.” The lyrics are delivered in standard American English with a neutral accent, and the vocal style—characterized by a soft, mid-range timbre, subtle vibrato, and a touch of rasp—conveys vulnerability and nostalgia. The phrasing is smooth and legato, with the final word (“made you—”) trailing off, indicating the clip is an excerpt from a longer piece.

Throughout the clip, the music remains emotionally charged but restrained, with a slow, steady tempo and a minor key that enhances the sense of longing and melancholy. The arrangement features a repeating bass motif, a high-frequency arpeggio, and a shimmering synth pad that contribute to the atmosphere. There are no abrupt transitions or changes in intensity; the mood is one of contemplation and emotional release.

The production quality is high, with the mix favoring a balanced blend of vocals and instruments. The vocal is centered in the mix, while the synth pads and percussion spread across the stereo field, creating a sense of depth and space. The dynamic range is compressed, maintaining a consistent volume and immersive feel. The recording is likely a studio or digital production, with no evidence of live performance or environmental artifacts.

In summary, the audio clip is a polished excerpt from a contemporary pop/R&B ballad, featuring a male vocalist reflecting on lost love and youthful innocence. The lyrics and musical style are emblematic of modern, emotionally-driven music, and the production is sophisticated, blending electronic elements with intimate vocals to create a resonant, introspective listening experience.",40.0,117.45383522727272,78,1589.9329056906613,3432.4713124138493,0.0411964279236796,14.015005111694336,160.00674438476562,"[0.23720571398735046, 0.30670103430747986, 0.3088128864765167, 0.2672286927700043, 0.3620612919330597, 0.2526647448539734, 0.27349233627319336, 0.22574123740196228, 0.26139023900032043, 0.3787841200828552, 0.28696364164352417, 0.2608754634857178]","[0.2716432213783264, 0.29683858156204224, 0.25439682602882385, 0.2597615122795105, 0.2913486361503601, 0.2252240628004074, 0.2784208655357361, 0.22240661084651947, 0.29385778307914734, 0.38381168246269226, 0.296262264251709, 0.349106103181839]",1157.28667624004,1801.8213911271932
8,Healing,"Gordo, Drake","The audio clip begins with the ambient sounds of a natural, outdoor environment—crickets chirping, faint birdsong, and a gentle breeze rustling through leaves—establishing a calm, tranquil setting. A male speaker with a distinct East African accent, likely from Kenya or Tanzania, narrates in a slow, reflective manner, describing a peaceful early morning walk. His tone is relaxed and intimate, and he shares personal thoughts about his wife: he fondly recalls their conversations, laughter, and shared memories, while also revealing a quiet hope that she will continue enjoying life as she grows older. His speech is unhurried, marked by natural pauses and a gentle, almost wistful delivery. The recording is high-fidelity, capturing subtle breaths and the soft rustle of clothing, with no electronic noise or distortion.

At a pivotal moment, a sharp, artificial click signals a hard edit, instantly silencing the natural sounds and transitioning the mood. The environment becomes sterile and studio-like, with a faint electronic hum and a subtle, rhythmic ticking reminiscent of a clock or metronome. A young male voice, processed with heavy reverb, begins to sing in a modern, emotionally charged R&B/Pop style. His voice is clear, smooth, and emotionally vulnerable, with lyrics expressing a resolve to stop self-harm and a desire for personal change. The music is minimal, featuring a soft piano or keyboard, subtle synthesized bass, and ambient electronic pads, creating a spacious and melancholic atmosphere. The vocal performance is marked by a slight pitch instability and a breathy, introspective delivery, further amplifying the sense of vulnerability.

The transition between the two sections is abrupt, emphasizing a contrast between the grounded, real-world intimacy of the first part and the stylized, emotionally charged introspection of the second. The clip concludes with a hard cut, leaving the musical narrative unresolved and evoking a sense of tension and longing.

In summary, the audio presents a carefully constructed narrative: a personal, reflective monologue set in a peaceful natural environment, followed by a sudden shift to a modern, emotionally raw musical segment. The deliberate contrast between the two sections, combined with high-quality production and expressive performances, creates a compelling and evocative listening experience that bridges the real and the imagined.",37.46902494331066,123.046875,77,2416.195147285504,5324.077801899396,0.1049565689862143,-27.017240524291992,250.4298858642578,"[0.2708510160446167, 0.313921719789505, 0.31964486837387085, 0.30473965406417847, 0.2834017872810364, 0.28551992774009705, 0.2894446849822998, 0.2701248526573181, 0.2649376690387726, 0.28176602721214294, 0.29270923137664795, 0.2814376950263977]","[0.3071552515029907, 0.44597360491752625, 0.27005621790885925, 0.23367711901664734, 0.2699432671070099, 0.19564662873744965, 0.17383551597595215, 0.21170645952224731, 0.3501817584037781, 0.30562645196914673, 0.293283611536026, 0.3016493618488312]",2248.1280105194433,1363.1300159637171
9,Best Day of My Life (BUNT. Version),"BUNT., Tom Odell","The audio clip opens with a female vocalist delivering the lyric, “I think today is the best day of my life,” in a clear, bright tone. Her voice is enhanced with heavy digital reverb and a subtle pitch-shifted effect, creating an ethereal, distant quality. This line is accompanied by a steady four-on-the-floor kick drum, a deep sub-bass, and a soft synth pad that fills out the harmonic background. The overall sound is clean and professionally produced, with no ambient noise or live room acoustics.

As the track progresses, the singer continues with “not thinking about the future all the time,” maintaining a relaxed, conversational style. During this section, the phrase “I’m alone, I’m alone, I don’t mind” is repeated, with each “I’m alone” delivered with a slightly altered pitch and rhythm, and each “I don’t mind” sung lower and more slowly. These repetitions, along with a subtle increase in percussion and synth layers, build a sense of introspective melancholy.

The main melodic and lyrical motif is repeated, reinforcing the themes of contentment and solitude. The vocalist then sings, “I’m happy to be alone,” with a gentle, unhurried delivery that further emphasizes the mood of peaceful acceptance.

Midway through, the track introduces a new melodic element: a bright, bell-like synth arpeggio that adds a shimmering texture. The lyrics shift to “through the stars and black black pictures,” delivered in a higher register and with more pronounced reverb, creating a dreamy, expansive atmosphere. The instrumental arrangement remains steady, with a consistent bassline and percussion.

In the closing segment, the singer utters the phrase “one million,” with each word spaced out and trailing into the reverb, leaving a lingering emotional impression. The track ends abruptly, cutting off mid-phrase with no fadeout or resolution, highlighting the unfinished nature of the recording.

Throughout, the production is high-fidelity and modern, with a wide stereo field, prominent sub-bass, and a balanced mix of vocals and instruments. The vocal style is conversational and intimate, supported by electronic textures and effects typical of contemporary indie pop and electronic genres. The lyrics explore themes of present-moment contentment, solitude, and introspection, with no overt references to specific cultural or geographic contexts. The overall mood is melancholic yet accepting, marked by a sense of calm and emotional vulnerability.

In summary, this audio excerpt presents a polished, modern electronic pop track featuring a female vocalist who reflects on solitude and present happiness. The production is clean and atmospheric, with layers of reverb, pitch-shifting, and synth arpeggios that evoke a sense of dreamy introspection. The lyrics and musical arrangement suggest a mood of quiet acceptance, set within a contemporary indie pop context, and the clip concludes with an abrupt cutoff, leaving the listener suspended in unresolved emotion.",39.76780045351474,129.19921875,70,1733.3890810891278,3613.0213321612305,0.0620541903823701,12.98683738708496,156.48997497558594,"[0.34617045521736145, 0.46176794171333313, 0.23468399047851562, 0.2054874747991562, 0.22152306139469147, 0.295943945646286, 0.19079947471618652, 0.24227584898471832, 0.36369243264198303, 0.24907879531383514, 0.28100723028182983, 0.25416508316993713]","[0.291579008102417, 0.40655025839805603, 0.25785696506500244, 0.23401086032390594, 0.2540223002433777, 0.3448585867881775, 0.28762996196746826, 0.2649574875831604, 0.30669504404067993, 0.246424600481987, 0.2800164818763733, 0.2426166981458664]",1863.8829309242176,1553.9192875615893
10,First Time,"Seven Lions, SLANDER, Dabin, Dylan Matthew","The audio clip opens with a dramatic, cinematic soundscape: a swelling, low-frequency synth drone creates a tense, anticipatory atmosphere, accompanied by high-frequency digital textures and a subtle, persistent electronic hiss. This builds suspense as a sharp, synthetic percussive hit signals a transition. Immediately, a modern electronic beat drops—a punchy kick drum, crisp snare, and a syncopated, melodic synth bassline establish the rhythm. The track is characterized by a clean, digital sound, with wide stereo imaging and a polished, studio-produced mix.

A male vocalist enters, singing in English with a soft, breathy, and emotive delivery that blends seamlessly with the music. The vocal is drenched in reverb and delay, giving it a distant, ethereal quality that enhances the atmospheric mood. The lyrics, delivered with emotional clarity, are: “In the darkness, all I see is you.” The vocal melody is simple, descending, and melancholic, emphasizing vulnerability and longing.

Instrumentally, the arrangement is sparse and atmospheric, featuring sustained synth pads, a repeating arpeggiated synth motif, and a melodic, bass-like synth line. These elements, along with the vocal, are centered in the mix, while percussive and atmospheric textures fill out the stereo field. The production is modern and polished, with no audible distortion or analog noise, and a broad frequency range that balances deep bass with sparkling highs.

The emotional tone is introspective and melancholic, with a sense of hope emerging from the darkness, conveyed through both the lyrics and the musical arrangement. The genre blends elements of contemporary Electronic Pop, Chillstep, and Future Bass, with strong cinematic and atmospheric qualities. The music is designed for emotional impact and would suit a film, TV, or video game scene depicting longing, reflection, or a moment of revelation, especially in a modern, urban, or digital context.

In summary, the audio clip presents a high-fidelity, emotionally charged electronic pop track, blending cinematic sound design, modern production, and poignant lyrics to evoke a mood of vulnerability and hope amidst darkness.",36.145487528344674,198.76802884615384,115,1176.7063378796315,2177.7024814848264,0.0492787737837186,-13.244397163391112,214.0255584716797,"[0.2716277539730072, 0.17137818038463593, 0.18075084686279297, 0.27578049898147583, 0.1896207183599472, 0.2770947217941284, 0.5437315702438354, 0.32632309198379517, 0.2059820592403412, 0.1817968785762787, 0.20314475893974304, 0.395609974861145]","[0.2563824951648712, 0.2421531230211258, 0.2266739457845688, 0.3199652135372162, 0.27112266421318054, 0.28771209716796875, 0.31383344531059265, 0.21012535691261292, 0.2564019560813904, 0.2115650326013565, 0.32153552770614624, 0.45722460746765137]",1018.7683401132404,2089.7860983400624
