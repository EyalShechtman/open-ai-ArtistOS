SYSTEM OVERVIEW
----------------------------------------
This system uses a 4-component scoring algorithm to determine song compatibility:
1. Harmonic Score (40%): Chroma vector cosine similarity
2. Tempo Score (25%): BPM difference with Gaussian weighting
3. Timbre Score (20%): MFCC and spectral feature distance
4. Energy Score (15%): Spectral centroid continuity

Score ranges: 0.0 (poor) to 1.0 (excellent)
